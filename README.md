# Genetic-Strings
This app implements genetic algorithms in the context of the infinite monkey theorem. The genetic algorithm is based on <br />
the principles of Darwinian evolution.<br /><br />
The basic steps in the algorithm are:<br /><br />
**1)Creating a Population:** populate N elements with random DNA<br /><br />
**2)Selection:**<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Evaluate fitness: define a fitness function to describe the fitness of a member of the population<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)Create a mating pool: use a probabilistic method so that higher scoring members are more likely to contribute to the next<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generation<br /><br />
**3)Reproduction:**<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Crossover: combine parents to form children<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)Mutation: mutate genes randomly to introduce variation<br />
